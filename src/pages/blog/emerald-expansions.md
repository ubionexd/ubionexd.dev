**I just made my first mod!**  

I wanted to get into modding for a while now, but ModFest: Singularity just got announced and I really wanted to get into it now.  

The only problem was, that I don't know Java, I don't know the Fabric (and Quilt) modding toolchain so I had to learn it, and make a mod in a week.  

My first issue was, that I didn't knew, what to make, i didn't had an idea of what kind of mod I want to make. So I started a tutorial series and the reading of the Fabric Documentation, since the Quilt docs are very incomplete.  
At the end, I settled on making a mod with wierd add-ons to emeralds.  

I added everything, then realised, that i'm making a Fabric mod for a Quilt modding event, but fortunately for me, they accept any mod that runs on Quilt and since Quilt is a fork of Fabric, and they made it backwards compatable, I didn't had to port it over to Quilt, but I might do that in the future.

After I was done, I uploaded my mod to Modrinth, as requested by the organisers of ModFest: Singularity, added an image to Galery, made a nice description and badges, then submitted the project to ModFest: Singularity on thier Discord server.

If you want to take a look at Emerald Expansions' source code, it's available on GitHub. And if you also want to get started in modding, I highly recommend getting started in Fabric, since they have proper documentation and then learning Quilt, because they are more community focused and you can participate in interesting modding events like ModFest, Blanketcon, etc.

The tutorial series I watched is kaupenjoe's Fabric 1.18 and 1.19 modding serieses and I can easily recommend it for begginers, since I (a cereal) could easily understand and follow them.

The final mod can be found on [its Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/mod/emerald-expansions), and <mark>its not and never will be available on CurseForge.</mark>

Take care now!
