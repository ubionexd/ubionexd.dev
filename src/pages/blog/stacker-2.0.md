**Stacker 2.0 just got released and its more powerful than ever before!**  
<br />
**What even is stacker?**  
Stacker is a helper program for Minecraft to convert the amount of items to stacks and vice versa.  
Its written in Rust with minimal dependencies, focused on fast build times and wide platform support.  
Stacker is available for Linux, Windows, MacOS Intel and MacOS Apple Silicon (M1, M2) precompiled, which means, you can download the executables from stacker's GitHub page and you don't have to compile it from source code.  
Unfortunately, stacker can't be precompiled for all platforms, so you have to do it. If you interested in using stacker for example on your Android device, you can find instructions for doing so in stacker's [wiki](https://github.com/ubionexd/stacker/wiki/Compile-from-source).   
<br />
**What changed?**  
In this update, I...  
- added backwards calculations, which allows to convert the amount of stacks to items.
- added colors, to make the program output look a bit nicer.
- made support for MacOS ARM, to enable stacker to run on Mac devices with an M1 or M2 SoC without Rosetta.
- updated the help dialog to help users better understand how stacker works.
<br />
Enjoy!
